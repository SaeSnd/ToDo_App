# ToDo_App
It's a simple To-Do checklist app made in Vanilla JavaScript with Vite.

## How can i Execute in my computer this?
Before everything, you must have npm installed in your system (check with npm --version if you have it installed in your device).

1. Clone or fork this in your device.
2. Navigate into the directory where the files are, and execute ```npm i``` to install all the dependencies.
3. Use ```npm run dev``` to run locally in your device.

Thanks to [Fernando Herrera](https://github.com/Klerith) for helping and teaching me all the way to create this ToDo :)
